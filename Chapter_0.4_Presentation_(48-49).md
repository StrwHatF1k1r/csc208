## Image and Inverse Image 
## Chapter 0.4

### Image of a function:
#### In mathematics, the image of a function is the set of all output values it may produce.

More generally, evaluating a given function 
�
{\displaystyle f} at each element of a given subset 
�
{\displaystyle A} of its domain produces a set, called the "image of 
�
{\displaystyle A} under (or through) 
�
{\displaystyle f}".
